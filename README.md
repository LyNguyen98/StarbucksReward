# Disaster Response

**1. About the project**

These stimulated datasets contain information about customer behaviours on the Starbucks rewards mobile app and customer portfolio. Starbucks sends promotions or offers to users of the mobile app, it can be merely an advertisement for a drink, or an actual discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). However, the problem with these datasets is that not all user receive the same offer.
